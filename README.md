# CSY2026_AS1-Java

<h1>Aims & Objectives</h1>
<p>To enable the student to understand and extend Distributed Computing applications, using
the Java programming language and C# .NET utilising the Transmission Control Protocol
(TCP) as well as User Datagram Protocol (UDP).</p>
<h1>Brief:</h1>
<p>The netcat command line utility allows arbitrary TCP and UDP connections to be
established between two or more instances of the utility, or between the utility and other
applications, and for them to exchange data.</p>
<p>Two console based applications, written in both Java and C#, have much of the
functionality used by netcat. These source code behind these applications are available to
you to help with this assignment. These two applications allow each to act as a:</p>
<ul>
<li>TCP server</li>
<li>TCP client</li>
<li>UDP server</li>
<li>UDP client</li>
</ul>
<p>Complete the GUI based implementations of the graphical versions of netcat for Java and
C# so that these applications can be used in the same way as the netcat command line
utility (There is no need to design the GUI behind the Java and the C# GUI applications
as they are available as two skeleton applications. You need to implement and test the
code behind each application).</p>
<p>You also need to demonstrate that your two applications can communicate with
themselves and each other as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Java TCP Listener <-> Java TCP</li>
<li>Java UDP Listener <-> Java UDP</li>
<li>C# TCP Listener <-> C# TCP</li>
<li>C# UDP Listener <-> C# UDP</li>
<li>Java TCP Listener <-> C# TCP</li>
<li>Java UDP Listener <-> C# UDP</li>
<li>C# TCP Listener <-> Java TCP</li>
<li>C# UDP Listener <-> Java UDP</li>
</ul>
